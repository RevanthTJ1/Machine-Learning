# Machine-Learning
This repository consists of some of the projects which I have worked in the field of Machine Learning. Most of the projects is built on top of the existing libraries in Python(Language) since im still a beginner to this field hence trying to apply on what I have learnt so far. Im open to constructive criticism and suggestions.So if you have any please let me know. 
All of the datasets which I have worked on is available on the Kaggle website.
